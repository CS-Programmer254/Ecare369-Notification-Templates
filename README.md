# Ecare369-Notification-Templates
This repository contains event-driven notification templates (Email & SMS) used by the ECare 369 microservices ecosystem.
Templates are not hardcoded in application code.
They are fetched dynamically at runtime based on the integration event type being processed.
# Design Principles
Event-driven
Microservice-safe
